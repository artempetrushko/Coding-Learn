      "Finally, the robot got out of the cave. The exit turned out to be almost at the top of the ridge, on the opposite side, and thanks to this, early in the morning, with the sunrise, a wonderful view opened up: at the foot, below, a dense forest immediately began, which then gave way to mountains and In the center, cutting through the trees and rocks, there was a river, going straight to the plain, above which the castle towered.",
      "Encouraged, the robot began to descend, but after a couple of steps, he noticed that the hinge on his leg creaked unpleasantly, and generally had difficulty moving. It seems to have begun to rust after passing the test with bowls and water.",
      "The robot sat right there on the edge of the cliff and dismantled its limb to restore it to its proper state.",
      "When it came time to assemble the leg back, he realized that he had mixed all the parts, screws and nuts. To make assembly easier, he decided to carefully lay out and organize all the parts of the mechanism."

      "The robot gathered its leg, now it moved much more smoothly. When it descended, it was met by a dense, impenetrable forest. The path through it to the castle will take too long - the traveler thought and decided to build a raft from improvised means: this is risky solution, but the river would be much easier to get to, especially when it flows in the right direction.",
      "The robot entered the woods and began to collect materials: deadwood and sticks for the base, and flexible branches for the rope.",
      "After dragging everything to the river, he realized that he had collected too many things and different sizes. To build an even raft, you need to understand all this diversity and sort the materials."

      "After finishing with the construction, the robot pushed a wooden structure into the water, jumped on it, and was immediately carried away by the current.",
      "He lay down in the middle of the raft and, relaxing, looked at the floating clouds...",
      "Suddenly, he heard someone screaming, immediately jumped up and saw a man in the water, holding on to a branch of a tree that was hanging over the river.",
      "The robot swam up to the drowning man and dragged him onto the raft.",
      "He caught his breath and thanked his savior and said that he was fishing in the local waters, and he found himself in such an unenviable situation when he tried to get a net with a catch: his foot slipped and he landed in the river. But that's the trouble did not end, because all the fish slipped out of the nets, and now the fisherman was left with nothing, but he immediately noticed that it would be much more convenient for him to fish from a raft, and his house was just down the river. fisherman until he catches enough fish.",
      "The stranger happily began to take out a fishing rod and a box of spinners, but when he opened it, he found that they were all mixed up. Ay-ay-ay, not good - the fisherman muttered.",
      "He began to put everything in its place, and the traveler, again determined to help, also began to sort some of the fishing equipment."

      "The raft approached a small footbridge, the fisherman stepped ashore, once again thanked the mechanical traveler and went on his way with a solid catch, while the robot sailed away from the shore and moved on.",
      "Soon the sun went behind the clouds, the sky began to frown, the wind picked up, and everything indicated that it would soon rain. Meanwhile, the robot did not like this prospect at all.",
      "While he was thinking about how to hide from the water element, the plains abruptly gave way to high cliffs: the river carried the raft into the gorge.",
      "After moving a little further, the robot noticed a small grotto filled with warm glowing light from the inside, and a boat nearby. It decided to swim.",
      "He was met by a merchant sitting on a small stone island near the fire, under a canopy. The robot asked if there was a place for him here? In response, the merchant hospitably spread his hands and said something unintelligible, but with a friendly intonation.",
      "The mechanical traveler has docked his makeshift boat and climbed onto the island.",
      "He sat down next to the merchant, they started a conversation, and during the conversation, a good-natured stranger asked for help from the robot: he needed to sort the goods - it was easier to sell it, and he did not have time to do it before sailing. The guest agreed to help , after all, it was much more convenient for him to do it.",
      "Night fell. The robot was sitting by the fire, waiting out the rain, sorting through various goods..."

      "The robot finished sorting early at dawn. The merchant was still asleep, so the traveler decided to carefully, trying not to make any noise, climb onto the raft and move on.",
      "Gradually, the rocks became smaller and smaller, and after them flat landscapes began to prevail. The robot sat on the logs, enjoying the calm, clear weather, only some noise in the distance slightly disturbed this harmony. As the raft carried along flow, the sound became louder. The robot went through the options in the processor, what could it be ... ",
      "And then, around the bend, everything became clear: the noise was created by water falling down from a great height. The passenger of a small makeshift boat saw white foaming water ahead, and behind it - a sharp cliff. The raft carried faster and shook from side to side.",
      "The robot guessed the right moment and jumped ashore.",
      "Looking around, he saw a small mill where a farmer was digging in the ground.",
      "The traveler came closer and asked which way the castle was, supplementing his speech with gestures.",
      "He didn't understand any of what was said to him. The farmer seemed to be speaking some specific dialect. Luckily, the robot had a database in its memory for translating from several hundred languages."
