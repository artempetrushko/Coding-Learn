Someone obviously spent a lot of time here trying to find the right path. The robot noticed strange signs above the passages. With the help of a built-in translator, he quickly managed to decipher them, it turns out that it was the numbering: 4, 231, 6, 8993, 720. Against the background of various inscriptions, a strange charcoal poem stood out, in the language familiar to the robot: Yes, there are many options! But the number 6 will be correct! so simple? If the owner of the chest wrote this, then he must have resorted to mathematical tricks again."
