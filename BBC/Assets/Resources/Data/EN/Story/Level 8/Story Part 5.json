It smelled damp from there and the robot did not really want to go down there, since its parts could rust, but there was no other way."

On the ceiling, right above them, words were carved in a language he did not understand. Looking around, he noticed the same murmuring water flowing down the wall and flooding the whole floor."

      "Script": "Nearby lay another bowl, on the bottom of which was written: 'Pour the water where the words do not lose their meaning.' What could that mean?"

      "Script": "after a little thought, the robot realized what it could be about: after all, words are carved on the ceiling, and if you pour water into one of the bowls, then the corresponding word will be visible in the reflection. However, it will be mirrored and therefore lose the whole point. So, you need to find a bowl, over which there is a palindrome word that reads the same on both sides. "
