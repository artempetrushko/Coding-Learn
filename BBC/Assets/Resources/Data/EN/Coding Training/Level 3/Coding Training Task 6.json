"Info": "While the if, else and else if constructs are great, sometimes you can do things in a more elegant way. And the name of this method is <color=green>switch</color>.\n The <color=green>switch construct </color> allows you to compare the value passed to it with some cases (<color=green>case</color> s). In case of a match, the code provided for this case is executed.",

{
"Title": "End case",
"Info": "Each case ends with some <color=green>word-operator</color>. There are several of them, but we will use the most popular - <color=green>break</color>, so that the program does not check the following cases and exited the switch.As you can see, the case does not use curly braces, so the code is shorter and cleaner.",

},
{
"Title": "Operator default",
"Info": " In addition to case, you can use the useful <color=green>default</color> statement in the switch construct. It allows you to execute some code in the case when the passed <color=green> value did not match any case- om</color>. If one of the cases worked, the code in default will be skipped.",
