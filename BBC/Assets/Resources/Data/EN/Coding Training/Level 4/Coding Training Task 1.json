It can be used in situations where the number of iterations (loop repetitions) is known before entering the loop. It has the following form:\n for (<initialization>; <condition>; <execution order>) \n {\n <actions>\n }\n <color=green>Initialization</color> — setting the initial parameters of the counter;\n <color=green> Condition</color> is a condition for exiting the loop, as soon as it returns false, the loop will exit;\n <color=green>Execution order</color> is a command to increase the counter.\n Actions performed cyclically are called the loop body .",

At each iteration, add the value to the variable, check again condition and execute the loop body, and so on, until the condition (i < 10) is true. ",
