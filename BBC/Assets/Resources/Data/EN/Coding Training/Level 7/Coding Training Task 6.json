      "Info": "Dictionaries are another common collection type. A dictionary stores objects that represent a key-value pair. The Dictionary<K, V> dictionary class is typed with two types: the K parameter represents the key type, and the V parameter provides the value type. \n \n If we draw a rough analogy, we can say that a dictionary is a list, but instead of its indices, it can be anything and in any order.Agree, this is convenient if you need to store pairs of data together, for example, a word and its translation Then the key can be a word in your native language, and the value can be the translation of this word, or vice versa. store in a very inconvenient format.",
