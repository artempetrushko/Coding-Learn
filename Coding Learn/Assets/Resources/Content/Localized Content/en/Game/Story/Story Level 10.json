      "The robot was able to translate the words of a local farmer and, with instructions, it moved on. Its path ran through hilly fields and plains lit by the bright sun.",
      "Climbing another hill, he saw on the horizon the same castle that he had seen from afar, from the top of the mountain range. Dazzling white, it towered above the ground. Many towers of different heights complemented and expanded the already immense building.",
      "The robot immediately headed towards the castle, its legs moving faster, it was in a hurry to get inside, it was in a hurry to find out what was there, beyond its walls.",
      "Finally, the traveler got closer. No one came out to meet him or even looked out of the windows. Not a single sound came from behind the walls.",
      "Having stopped, the robot took another look at the castle. It had been standing here for a long time, but, as if it had just appeared out of nowhere, it looked unnaturally perfect: the masonry was even, there were no cracks, no cracks, no chips; the walls had a uniform white color, without stains and dirt. This isolated place seemed somehow artificial, inanimate, it was the embodiment of ideal order. ",
      "The robot's further path was blocked by a deep ditch with water. On the other side, a folding bridge stood vertically, which was held by old chains. The traveler noticed that the link of one of the chains was already almost , it will be possible to get inside the castle ... "

      "The stone hit the target and knocked out the damaged link. The whole structure was dragged down, the second chain, unable to withstand the load, also gave slack, the bridge collapsed across the moat with a crash.",
      "The robot walked over it through an archway and into a vast clear area.",
      "It was quiet here, completely deserted and empty. The wind drove dry leaves over the cold stone, and besides them, only a couple of long-dead trees stood out against the white background.",
      "The traveler walked past empty flower beds and dry fountains, looking around warily.",
      "Then he quickened his pace, wanting to get out of this uncomfortable open space as soon as possible, and did not notice how he ran into a white wall. He moved away to completely cover it with his eyes.",
      "These were two massive doors of great height - the robot went right up to the main gate of the castle.",
      "He tried to pull the handles, but the doors didn't budge or even make a sound.",
      "Thinking about it, the robot heard a strange monotonous ticking and decided to check where it came from. On the side of the right door, on the wall, he saw a mechanical device that looked like a combination drum lock, but there was something unusual in it for products of this kind: the rings, which are supposed to be turned by hand, moved by themselves with small pauses, making characteristic clicks.",
      "The robot came closer and looked closely at the engraving on the rings: each of them was inscribed with something resembling mathematical brackets. A little to the right of the lock was a small button with the image of a circle divided vertically. The robot assumed that these halves of the circle in the figure are quite could symbolize paired brackets ... "

      "Thick gears in the castle walls began to work, making a heavy metallic sound, and with it, the doors slowly opened to the sides. The robot squeezed inside and entered the large throne room.",
      "He found himself in a white spacious room with infinitely high ceilings, filled with light from many windows. Like a square, it was empty and clean: it lacked bright decorations, gilded elements and banners. The only thing that immediately caught the eye on against the background of everything else, there was a black and white field on the floor, right in the center, resembling a chessboard.At the very end of the hall was a wide pyramid, on the last step of which a robot sat on a small stone throne with its head down. I didn't turn it on for a long time. There were only more questions.",
      "The traveler took a couple of steps forward from the entrance and heard a loud bang followed by a long rolling echo. He turned around sharply - the door was closed.",
      "Realizing that there is no way back, the robot decided to go further and look around. Soon he noticed that there was not a single door here, not a single passage to other rooms, which is strange, given the size of the castle. Household items and decorations in the castle was also missing.",
      "Near the black-and-white grid on the floor, the robot saw a small panel on a counter that looked like some ancient mechanical device. It moved closer and pressed the center button.",
      "Right under his feet, some mechanisms hummed, and after a couple of seconds, chess pieces began to slowly rise from under the floor. The size of these statues was impressive, some even exceeded the height of a robot. It looked like it really was a playing field. The robot pressed another button: the mechanisms somewhere in the depths began their work again, and one of the chess pieces from its side moved to the adjacent cell. After a couple of moments, the statue from the opposite end moved in response.",
      "The traveler has decided to take part in this game of royal proportions."

      "Finally, the long game came to an end - the robot won, but something was still a mystery to him: who was he playing against? While he was trying to find the answer to this question, the remaining pieces slowly and evenly fell back down, under the chess field. Soon, complete silence reigned in the hall.",
      "The traveler finally decided to get a better look at the one on the throne. He carefully climbed the steps and came closer: it was a very old and incredibly skillfully designed robot. Its body showed exposed parts, gears, various tubes, which were supposed to power it. It was created long before the digital age and seems to be powered by some kind of winding mechanism.",
      "Looking around, the robot noticed several similar ancient objects in small arches carved into the wall. They were made a little rougher and more primitive, and each of them held a sword in their hands. Apparently, these were the guards who was meant to guard this place.",
      "The Traveler returned his gaze to the robot seated on the throne. He had no weapon, but in his right palm was a strange cube-shaped object, similar in origin to its owner: it looked like some kind of either a mechanical artifact or a very complex structure with a bunch of gears and moving parts, which is part of something even more complex. The robot extended its hand to the cube.",
      "Before he touched it, suddenly, a metallic rumble sounded from the side. The traveler shuddered and turned in the direction of the noise: two guards were heading straight for him. Their movements were sharp and confident.",
      "One of them immediately began to gradually slow down until it finally stopped completely, while the other continued to advance. The robot took a couple of steps back, but the guard quickly approached him and began to strike one after another.",
      "The traveler only had time to dodge and move further and further away. Judging by the fact that only two guardians activated, and one of them froze rather quickly, the robot only needed to hold out for a while until the winding mechanism of the latter completely stopped. "

      "The guardian's clockwork ticked less and less every second, until it finally stopped completely. The robot cautiously approached it and jabbed a couple of times in the body. The guard only wobbled a little.",
      "Convinced that the danger had passed, the traveler went up the stairs to look at the mysterious artifact once again. He took it and turned it in his hands: the cube turned out to be quite weighty for its size. All its many different parts were made of metal, in color reminiscent of gold or copper. It seems that it once shone brightly in the light, shimmering with yellow highlights, but has long lost this feature due to working scratches and scuffs.",
      "“It must fit somewhere…” - the traveler thought and began to look for what this item could be intended for. Walking around the entire hall up and down, he did not find a suitable place for it and then decided to put the item back ",
      "Climbing the steps again, he approached the motionless ancient robot, and returning the artifact to his palm, noticed through the fingers of his right hand some kind of depression in the armrest of the throne. He moved his hand away and saw a square hole, on the inner walls of which there were gear mechanisms, the same as on the sides of the cube outside. Everything looked like they should connect with each other and work together. ",
      "The robot placed the artifact in a recess, moved it a little from side to side, and the gears joined. After that, he tried to spin one of the disks on the top face of the cube: all the details began to move, making a characteristic sound that goes somewhere far away down, and chess pieces already familiar to the robot began to rise from under the floor.",
      "He hurriedly turned the disk in the opposite direction, accidentally hitting another one nearby. After that, the figures descended back, and then a door leading to other rooms opened slightly in the wall opposite. Previously, the robot did not even notice it: so it blended very well with the surroundings.It seems that the cube is a kind of key with which you can control this mechanical lock, and now the robot is its owner.It is not known what happened to the previous owner, sitting on the throne posthumously, but apparently, his reign The robot thought that for a start, it should figure out how to open the central gate, because it was still locked.However, acting at random, turning all the disks at once, was unwise: under the control of this key could be anything, including the activation of the guards. There must definitely be some kind of pattern in the control mechanism, so the robot decided to study it in detail. "
