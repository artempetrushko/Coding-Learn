      "Both if and else will help you here",

    "Description": " - You need to implement a method that decides what to do with the current log.\n The length of the log is passed to the method. If the length of the log is less than or equal to 3, nothing needs to be done with it.\nIf it is greater than 3, but less than 7, put it in the wagon.\n If greater than or equal to 7, cut the log.\n Use SkipLog, PutLogInCart and Ð¡hopLog methods respectively",

It is guaranteed that a suitable log exists\nThe state of the bridge is passed as input as a bool, the length of the account through which the bridge runs and the lengths of 3 available logs.\n To signal the start of movement, return the current state of the bridge (if logs were used, then the state of the bridge must be changed to slave). \n To use the UseLog method, passing in the length of a suitable log to use the desired log.",
