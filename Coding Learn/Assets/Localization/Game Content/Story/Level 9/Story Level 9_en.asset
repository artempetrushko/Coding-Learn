    m_Localized: 'Finally, the robot got out of the cave. The exit turned out to
      be almost at the top of the ridge, on the opposite side, and thanks to this,
      early in the morning, with the sunrise, a wonderful view opened up: at the
      foot, below, a dense forest immediately began, which then gave way to mountains
      and In the center, cutting through the trees and rocks, there was a river,
      going straight to the plain, above which the castle towered.'

    m_Localized: Encouraged, the robot began to descend, but after a couple of steps,
      he noticed that the hinge on his leg creaked unpleasantly, and generally had
      difficulty moving. It seems to have begun to rust after passing the test with
      bowls and water.

    m_Localized: When it came time to assemble the leg back, he realized that he
      had mixed all the parts, screws and nuts. To make assembly easier, he decided
      to carefully lay out and organize all the parts of the mechanism.

    m_Localized: 'The robot gathered its leg, now it moved much more smoothly. When
      it descended, it was met by a dense, impenetrable forest. The path through
      it to the castle will take too long - the traveler thought and decided to build
      a raft from improvised means: this is risky solution, but the river would be
      much easier to get to, especially when it flows in the right direction.'

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: 'The robot entered the woods and began to collect materials: deadwood
      and sticks for the base, and flexible branches for the rope.'

    m_Localized: After dragging everything to the river, he realized that he had
      collected too many things and different sizes. To build an even raft, you need
      to understand all this diversity and sort the materials.

    m_Localized: 'He caught his breath and thanked his savior and said that he was
      fishing in the local waters, and he found himself in such an unenviable situation
      when he tried to get a net with a catch: his foot slipped and he landed in
      the river. But that''s the trouble did not end, because all the fish slipped
      out of the nets, and now the fisherman was left with nothing, but he immediately
      noticed that it would be much more convenient for him to fish from a raft,
      and his house was just down the river. fisherman until he catches enough fish.'

    m_Localized: Soon the sun went behind the clouds, the sky began to frown, the

    m_Localized: He was met by a merchant sitting on a small stone island near the

    m_Localized: 'He sat down next to the merchant, they started a conversation,
      and during the conversation, a good-natured stranger asked for help from the
      robot: he needed to sort the goods - it was easier to sell it, and he did not
      have time to do it before sailing. The guest agreed to help , after all, it
      was much more convenient for him to do it.'

  - m_Id: 375268368406
    m_Localized: Gradually, the rocks became smaller and smaller, and after them
      flat landscapes began to prevail. The robot sat on the logs, enjoying the calm,
      clear weather, only some noise in the distance slightly disturbed this harmony.
      As the raft carried along flow, the sound became louder. The robot went through
      the options in the processor, what could it be ...

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 375268368407
    m_Localized: 'And then, around the bend, everything became clear: the noise was
      created by water falling down from a great height. The passenger of a small
      makeshift boat saw white foaming water ahead, and behind it - a sharp cliff.
      The raft carried faster and shook from side to side.'
