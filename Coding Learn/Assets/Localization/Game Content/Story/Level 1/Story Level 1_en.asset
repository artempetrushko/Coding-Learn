    m_Localized: All things were done in the bathroom and the Robot rushed to leave
      that room.

  - m_Id: 84216574173196
    m_Localized: The Robot walked to the other end of the corridor and turned into
      the bathroom. Two instructions at once became active in his program - to collect
      water in a bucket to wash the floor, as well as to draw water (but already
      hot) into the bath so that children can swim.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173195
    m_Localized: Many orders have already been completed, but some are still waiting
      for our hero ahead.

    m_Localized: The family was going to bake apple pie and pizza in the evening.
      It was necessary to knead the dough, since all the ingredients were in abundance.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173193
    m_Localized: The task was completed, another assignment was waiting for the Robot
      in the kitchen.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173200
    m_Localized: Nothing was found in the safe, and the Robot moved to the first
      floor to inform the owner about it. There was no one in the house now, but
      the door to the street was slightly ajar. It was always kept closed so that
      the Robot did not accidentally go anywhere, but now nothing prevented him from
      leaving the house. Our hero went outside.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173192
    m_Localized: All the fish, seeing the two-meter Robot, hid in stones and algae.
      But of course, the Robot did not want to harm them, but only to pour food on
      them. At the same time, he began to calculate how many days of food remained.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173199
    m_Localized: The owner of the house lost his glasses and asked the Robot to look
      for them. Perhaps he accidentally left them in a safe when he shifted things
      in it. The Robot set to work.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173198
    m_Localized: There was only one assignment left, it was waiting for our hero
      in the parent's bedroom.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173191
    m_Localized: Having taken food, our hero went out into the corridor and went
      to the aquarium.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173190
    m_Localized: Seeing the refrigerator, the Robot program chose a new task to perform
      - to feed the fish that live in the aquarium in the corridor. The food lay
      in a separate compartment, and the Robot began to look for it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173189
    m_Localized: There was a door to the kitchen in front of the nursery. There the
      robot was also waiting for work, and therefore he approached the tightly closed
      door to open it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173188
    m_Localized: All things in this room were done, and our hero went out into the
      corridor.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173187
    m_Localized: It was clean enough here, but the iron assistant was attracted to
      another. One of the households apparently decided to study programming and
      wrote a small program. It's remained open, and the robot, driven by its curiosity,
      decided to launch it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173186
    m_Localized: Having laid things out in places, the robot headed to the other
      end of the room, where there was another table.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84216574173185
    m_Localized: Now there was no one in the nursery, so he decided to clean up on
      the table where a bunch of different things lay.
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 84216574173184
    m_Localized: On one ordinary day, in a large and secluded house in the middle
      of the forest, our hero woke up - a humanoid Robot. Every morning it turns
      on to help people living here around the house - to do cleaning and carry out
      different assignments.
