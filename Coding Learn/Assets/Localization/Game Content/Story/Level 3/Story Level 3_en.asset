  m_Metadata:
    m_Items: []
  m_TableData:
  - m_Id: 583561699328
    m_Localized: Soon after the start of its journey, the Robot began to increasingly
      see tall trees on both sides of the trail. It wandered into the thick of the
      forest.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670848
    m_Localized: Fortunately (and at the same time unfortunately), the Robot stood
      at a crossroads. It became clear that it would not be lost here, but it was
      absolutely unclear where to go. The pointer in front of it could help solve
      this problem.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670849
    m_Localized: Our hero decided to turn right and moved on the clearly visible
      path further.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670850
    m_Localized: Turning a little, it noticed something unusual a little at a distance
      and hurried there.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670851
    m_Localized: A cart with logs, felled trees and an ax in the stump made it clear
      to him - this is a favorite place for lumberjacks. There was no one nearby,
      and therefore the Robot decided to help them in their difficult work. In the
      end, it was created to help others.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670852
    m_Localized: And now the work is over! Those who work here will definitely appreciate
      the help of an iron friend.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670853
    m_Localized: However, there was nowhere to move on, and therefore the Robot had
      to return to the crossroads and go another way.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670854
    m_Localized: At the next intersection, it wanted to turn to the right, but something
      attracted its attention.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670855
    m_Localized: They were wild mushrooms. They were familiar to our hero, but here
      they grew in much larger numbers ." What if you disrupt one of them ?" it thought
      and began to choose the most interesting for itself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670856
    m_Localized: The Robot liked the mushroom with a large umbrella-like hat. Having
      seen enough, it decided to leave the mushroom in a bucket standing here. It
      also prompted our hero to think that there was someone here, and therefore
      it hastened to go away into the forest.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670857
    m_Localized: But just a few meters from the mushroom clearing, the Robot found
      a burning fire. The program instructs it to put out the fire if no one controls
      it. There was no one around, and therefore the hero began to act.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670858
    m_Localized: Confident that nothing threatens the forest, the Robot moved on.
      By that time, it had come quite a long way.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670859
    m_Localized: But further progress was in question, for a river arose before the
      hero. There was no bridge, like any other crossing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670860
    m_Localized: But there were large logs nearby, and perhaps someone was going
      to start building a bridge here. Our Robot chose to solve this problem now.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670861
    m_Localized: Throwing logs across the river, the Robot began to carefully cross
      them to the other side. The most important thing at that moment was to maintain
      balance and not fall, because the current was quite strong.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670862
    m_Localized: But everything went well, and the Robot moved further along the
      trail.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670863
    m_Localized: However, an unpleasant fork awaited it a little further away. Instead
      of signs, there were piles of stones, and what they meant was completely unclear.
      It seems that now the Robot had to make a difficult choice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670864
    m_Localized: Our hero decided to move to the right, although it did not like
      any of the options - the car, which was used to living with clear algorithms,
      was unpleasant the complete uncertainty of the routes here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670865
    m_Localized: But here the Robot was waiting for another disappointment - a new
      crossroads. There were fewer ways going far here, but this did not make it
      easier.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670866
    m_Localized: And the Robot again chose its path. Where it leads, it also had
      no clue.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 583582670867
    m_Localized: Nevertheless, the curiosity of the Robot was too great to turn back,
      so it decided to continue his journey.
