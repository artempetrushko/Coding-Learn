    m_Items: []
  m_TableData:
  - m_Id: 417433706496
    m_Localized: It was already dawn when the robot saw smoke coming from the chimneys
      and the roof of the houses nearby. It was a village. And it looks like some
      of the inhabitants are walking towards it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483712
    m_Localized: It was the old lady who dropped the basket of apples and was trying
      to pick it up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483713
    m_Localized: The robot approached her to help. The woman was taken aback and
      stood stock-still, not expecting to see an iron helper here. But the robot,
      despite this, continued to pick apples.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483714
    m_Localized: The woman quietly thanked the robot and hurried to the village.
      Our hero was attracted by the sound of an ax coming from behind the bushes.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483715
    m_Localized: The robot went there and met a lumberjack. He had been watching
      the robot picking apples all this time, and didn't seem to be afraid of the
      iron stranger at all. On the contrary, he asked the hero for a favor - to take
      firewood to the trader.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483716
    m_Localized: The robot did a great job and went on a lumberjack's errand.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483717
    m_Localized: The merchant was very close. Our hero gave him firewood, for which
      he received gratitude from the locals. There were two of them around the fire
      - the merchant and his friend.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483718
    m_Localized: 'The second suggested that the robot play a card game: take a few
      cards, memorize them, and then try to draw the highest one in order to defeat
      the opponent. Our hero''s memory was impeccable, and therefore he agreed to
      play.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483719
    m_Localized: The iron helper drew the biggest card available, but lost - the
      merchant's friend had stronger cards. Then the robot decided to end the game
      and move on.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483720
    m_Localized: There was an inn nearby, and the robot decided to ask the workers
      how to get to the castle in the mountains.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483721
    m_Localized: He was no longer feared, but warmly welcomed - the woman who dropped
      the apples told everyone about the kindness and generosity of the iron man.
      The tavern worker brought a map and began to show the robot the route.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483722
    m_Localized: The road to the east led to the castle, but since it was still early
      in the morning, the robot decided to walk around the village and see what the
      inhabitants were doing. He was attracted by someone in a black robe.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483723
    m_Localized: It was the elder. He goes out every morning to watch the sunrise
      and see how life begins to boil in the village. The robot asked if he could
      help the villagers in any way. The elder suggested that the assistant go to
      the shore and ask the miller and the boatman.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483724
    m_Localized: The robot was about to go, but the elder asked to stay a little
      longer. He was very curious to know a little more about our hero, more precisely,
      about his mental abilities and ingenuity, and asked a riddle - in which hand
      does he hold a pebble?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483725
    m_Localized: The robot correctly answered the elder's question and moved towards
      the shore, towards the mill.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483726
    m_Localized: He saw a sad miller sitting on a bench. After talking to a villager,
      the robot found out that the mill had several gears out of order and was therefore
      not working.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483727
    m_Localized: Our hero decided to help the miller and began to inspect a nearby
      box with various trash and scrap metal. Perhaps an attentive robot will be
      able to find something suitable to replace it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483728
    m_Localized: All suitable parts were found, and after a while the miller was
      able to repair the windmill. Warmly thanking the robot, he began to admire
      the mechanism again working, and our hero decided to walk to the boatman.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417450483729
    m_Localized: Looks like he could use some help too. He just finished building
      a few boats and needed to see how much cargo they could hold on the water.
      Our hero would be really handy here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417454678016
    m_Localized: The job was successfully completed. It was already daylight, so
      now you can move on. The robot returned to the center of the village and found
      the right path.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417454678017
    m_Localized: The robot has taken this road on an adventure
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 417454678018
    m_Localized: The robot said goodbye to those who met on its way and left this
      place and moved on. It was getting closer to the mountains, where the treasure
      castle was waiting for him.
