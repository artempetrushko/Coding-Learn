    m_Localized: The robot came to a small dark crevice that goes far into the depths
      of the mountain range. It seems that this is exactly the place that his friend
      was talking about when he sent the SOS signal. Without thinking twice, he went
      inside. Darkness enveloped him from all sides , only a small amount of light
      was coming from the entrance.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707200
    m_Localized: Ahead, there were barely visible outlines of some long-abandoned
      camp. It was impossible to move further in the darkness, and therefore the
      robot decided to look for at least something that could emit light. On the
      ground, in addition to stones, various debris and debris, there were long-extinguished
      torches. However, without fire, they were of no use.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707201
    m_Localized: The mechanical traveler continued his search, and soon found a small
      chest with a combination lock on his eyepieces.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707202
    m_Localized: "After examining it and holding it up to the light from the crevice,
      the robot noticed a note at the bottom: \u201D1.1^10 after the decimal point\u201D.
      Apparently, the owner left this riddle so as not to forget the code."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707203
    m_Localized: Bingo! The hint turned out to be correct, and in the chest, among
      other things, there was a flint and a jar of resin for the torch. The robot
      smeared the torch with a viscous substance and struck sparks over it a couple
      of times.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707204
    m_Localized: The fire broke out, and the traveler began to gradually move deep
      into the mighty ridge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707205
    m_Localized: 'The cave turned out to be by no means small: there were many branches
      and forks along the way, the only thing that gave confidence was that they
      were all small and stood out against the background of the main tunnel.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707206
    m_Localized: 'However, having reached the next fork, the robot could no longer
      choose a direction: the main road became too much like secondary ones.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707207
    m_Localized: 'In the light of the torch, various scribbles, some numbers and
      crossed out words were visible on the stone walls. Someone obviously spent
      a lot of time here trying to find the right path. The robot noticed strange
      signs above the passages. With the help of a built-in translator, he quickly
      managed to decipher them, it turns out that it was the numbering: 4, 231, 6,
      8993, 720. Against the background of various inscriptions, a strange charcoal
      poem stood out, in the language familiar to the robot: Yes, there are many
      options! But the number 6 will be correct! so simple? If the owner of the chest
      wrote this, then he must have resorted to mathematical tricks again.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707208
    m_Localized: The factorial of six turned out to be 720, and the robot decided
      to follow the path with that number.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405798707209
    m_Localized: Soon, the cramped tunnel began to expand rapidly, and then gave
      way to a spacious long corridor, at the end of which a metal grate was visible,
      blocking the path further.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901504
    m_Localized: 'Above it were the numbers: 34. Nearby, on one of the walls, there
      was a set of levers. Moving closer, the robot noticed that the first four levers
      were numbered: 1, 1, 2, 3 ..., and the remaining 6 were not. This sequence
      immediately seemed familiar to the robot: Perhaps these are Fibonacci numbers
      - he thought and decided to calculate the rest of the numbers.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901505
    m_Localized: The robot did the necessary calculations and numbered the remaining
      levers. It turned out that one of them has the same number as above the door
      - 34. Pulling on it, the robot saw how the steel bars in the passage were lowered.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901506
    m_Localized: Now the path is open and the robot has confidently moved on...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: He nearly fell into the hole right under his feet!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901508
    m_Localized: "He raised the torch higher: a spacious cave opened before him with
      a floor paved with stone slabs, but some of them were missing. Instead, there
      was a bottomless abyss, and the light of the fire did not allow one to assess
      what was down there. without thinking - dangerous, because it is not known
      which plates can still collapse. The robot noticed that different numbers were
      carved on each of them, and on the very first it was written: \u201CThe test
      will pass the one who finds a simple way.\u201D What if you only need to step
      on tiles containing prime numbers? The robot decided to take a chance and test
      his hypothesis."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901509
    m_Localized: 'The hypothesis turned out to be correct: the robot successfully
      passed to the opposite end of the cave. There was a narrow slippery passage
      ahead of it. It smelled damp from there and the robot did not really want to
      go down there, since its parts could rust, but there was no other way.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901510
    m_Localized: The robot began to gently descend, and the lower it was, the louder
      some kind of murmur became. Apparently, it was water.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901511
    m_Localized: Then he got into a room, in the center of which there were four
      small stone pedestals with bowls. On the ceiling, right above them, words were
      carved in a language he did not understand. Looking around, he noticed the
      same murmuring water flowing down the wall and flooding the whole floor.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901512
    m_Localized: 'Nearby lay another bowl, on the bottom of which was written: ''Pour
      the water where the words do not lose their meaning.'' What could that mean?'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901513
    m_Localized: 'after a little thought, the robot realized what it could be about:
      after all, words are carved on the ceiling, and if you pour water into one
      of the bowls, then the corresponding word will be visible in the reflection.
      However, it will be mirrored and therefore lose the whole point. So, you need
      to find a bowl, over which there is a palindrome word that reads the same on
      both sides.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901514
    m_Localized: The robot determined the word, drew water, then poured it into the
      right bowl, and under the influence of gravity, the vessel fell down.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901515
    m_Localized: Next, a staircase opened in the wall opposite, leading somewhere
      upstairs. It seems that the robot did everything right and the exit will be
      very soon.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901516
    m_Localized: As it rose, the light increased, and the familiar sounds of nature
      began to come up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901517
    m_Localized: Finally, the robot saw the rays of the sun breaking through a small
      archway. This is the way out! But the iron bars blocked the path again.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901518
    m_Localized: There was a path of pressure plates on the floor leading to it,
      one after the other in a row.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901519
    m_Localized: 'The robot couldn''t find any clues, all that was left to do was
      to experiment. He decided to step on the first slab and saw the rods go down
      a bit. Well, it seems simple, he thought, and stepped on the next slab, but
      this time nothing happened. He stepped aside and stood on it again: the bars
      again lowered a little. The next one also had to be stepped on twice.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901520
    m_Localized: The robot did an analytical calculation and found the most likely
      pattern. It remains to accurately calculate the required number of clicks on
      each plate, because if you make a mistake, you don't know what can happen.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 405802901521
    m_Localized: The robot moved on.
