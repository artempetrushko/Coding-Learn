    m_Localized: The robot was able to translate the words of a local farmer and,
      with instructions, it moved on. Its path ran through hilly fields and plains
      lit by the bright sun.

    m_Localized: Climbing another hill, he saw on the horizon the same castle that
      he had seen from afar, from the top of the mountain range. Dazzling white,
      it towered above the ground. Many towers of different heights complemented
      and expanded the already immense building.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816769
    m_Localized: The robot immediately headed towards the castle, its legs moving
      faster, it was in a hurry to get inside, it was in a hurry to find out what
      was there, beyond its walls.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816770
    m_Localized: Finally, the traveler got closer. No one came out to meet him or
      even looked out of the windows. Not a single sound came from behind the walls.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816771
    m_Localized: 'Having stopped, the robot took another look at the castle. It had
      been standing here for a long time, but, as if it had just appeared out of
      nowhere, it looked unnaturally perfect: the masonry was even, there were no
      cracks, no cracks, no chips; the walls had a uniform white color, without stains
      and dirt. This isolated place seemed somehow artificial, inanimate, it was
      the embodiment of ideal order.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816772
    m_Localized: The robot's further path was blocked by a deep ditch with water.
      On the other side, a folding bridge stood vertically, which was held by old
      chains. The traveler noticed that the link of one of the chains was already
      almost , it will be possible to get inside the castle ...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816773
    m_Localized: The stone hit the target and knocked out the damaged link. The whole
      structure was dragged down, the second chain, unable to withstand the load,
      also gave slack, the bridge collapsed across the moat with a crash.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816774
    m_Localized: The robot walked over it through an archway and into a vast clear
      area.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816775
    m_Localized: It was quiet here, completely deserted and empty. The wind drove
      dry leaves over the cold stone, and besides them, only a couple of long-dead
      trees stood out against the white background.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816776
    m_Localized: The traveler walked past empty flower beds and dry fountains, looking
      around warily.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816777
    m_Localized: Then he quickened his pace, wanting to get out of this uncomfortable
      open space as soon as possible, and did not notice how he ran into a white
      wall. He moved away to completely cover it with his eyes.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816778
    m_Localized: These were two massive doors of great height - the robot went right
      up to the main gate of the castle.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816779
    m_Localized: He tried to pull the handles, but the doors didn't budge or even
      make a sound.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816780
    m_Localized: 'Thinking about it, the robot heard a strange monotonous ticking
      and decided to check where it came from. On the side of the right door, on
      the wall, he saw a mechanical device that looked like a combination drum lock,
      but there was something unusual in it for products of this kind: the rings,
      which are supposed to be turned by hand, moved by themselves with small pauses,
      making characteristic clicks.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816781
    m_Localized: 'The robot came closer and looked closely at the engraving on the
      rings: each of them was inscribed with something resembling mathematical brackets.
      A little to the right of the lock was a small button with the image of a circle
      divided vertically. The robot assumed that these halves of the circle in the
      figure are quite could symbolize paired brackets ...'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816782
    m_Localized: Thick gears in the castle walls began to work, making a heavy metallic
      sound, and with it, the doors slowly opened to the sides. The robot squeezed
      inside and entered the large throne room.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816783
    m_Localized: 'He found himself in a white spacious room with infinitely high
      ceilings, filled with light from many windows. Like a square, it was empty
      and clean: it lacked bright decorations, gilded elements and banners. The only
      thing that immediately caught the eye on against the background of everything
      else, there was a black and white field on the floor, right in the center,
      resembling a chessboard.At the very end of the hall was a wide pyramid, on
      the last step of which a robot sat on a small stone throne with its head down.
      I didn''t turn it on for a long time. There were only more questions.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816784
    m_Localized: The traveler took a couple of steps forward from the entrance and
      heard a loud bang followed by a long rolling echo. He turned around sharply
      - the door was closed.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816785
    m_Localized: Realizing that there is no way back, the robot decided to go further
      and look around. Soon he noticed that there was not a single door here, not
      a single passage to other rooms, which is strange, given the size of the castle.
      Household items and decorations in the castle was also missing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816786
    m_Localized: Near the black-and-white grid on the floor, the robot saw a small
      panel on a counter that looked like some ancient mechanical device. It moved
      closer and pressed the center button.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816787
    m_Localized: 'Right under his feet, some mechanisms hummed, and after a couple
      of seconds, chess pieces began to slowly rise from under the floor. The size
      of these statues was impressive, some even exceeded the height of a robot.
      It looked like it really was a playing field. The robot pressed another button:
      the mechanisms somewhere in the depths began their work again, and one of the
      chess pieces from its side moved to the adjacent cell. After a couple of moments,
      the statue from the opposite end moved in response.'

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: The traveler has decided to take part in this game of royal proportions.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816789
    m_Localized: 'Finally, the long game came to an end - the robot won, but something
      was still a mystery to him: who was he playing against? While he was trying
      to find the answer to this question, the remaining pieces slowly and evenly
      fell back down, under the chess field. Soon, complete silence reigned in the
      hall.'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816790
    m_Localized: 'The traveler finally decided to get a better look at the one on
      the throne. He carefully climbed the steps and came closer: it was a very old
      and incredibly skillfully designed robot. Its body showed exposed parts, gears,
      various tubes, which were supposed to power it. It was created long before
      the digital age and seems to be powered by some kind of winding mechanism.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816791
    m_Localized: Looking around, the robot noticed several similar ancient objects
      in small arches carved into the wall. They were made a little rougher and more
      primitive, and each of them held a sword in their hands. Apparently, these
      were the guards who was meant to guard this place.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816792
    m_Localized: 'The Traveler returned his gaze to the robot seated on the throne.
      He had no weapon, but in his right palm was a strange cube-shaped object, similar
      in origin to its owner: it looked like some kind of either a mechanical artifact
      or a very complex structure with a bunch of gears and moving parts, which is
      part of something even more complex. The robot extended its hand to the cube.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816793
    m_Localized: 'Before he touched it, suddenly, a metallic rumble sounded from
      the side. The traveler shuddered and turned in the direction of the noise:
      two guards were heading straight for him. Their movements were sharp and confident.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328694816794
    m_Localized: One of them immediately began to gradually slow down until it finally
      stopped completely, while the other continued to advance. The robot took a
      couple of steps back, but the guard quickly approached him and began to strike
      one after another.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011072
    m_Localized: The traveler only had time to dodge and move further and further
      away. Judging by the fact that only two guardians activated, and one of them
      froze rather quickly, the robot only needed to hold out for a while until the
      winding mechanism of the latter completely stopped.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011073
    m_Localized: The guardian's clockwork ticked less and less every second, until
      it finally stopped completely. The robot cautiously approached it and jabbed
      a couple of times in the body. The guard only wobbled a little.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011074
    m_Localized: 'Convinced that the danger had passed, the traveler went up the
      stairs to look at the mysterious artifact once again. He took it and turned
      it in his hands: the cube turned out to be quite weighty for its size. All
      its many different parts were made of metal, in color reminiscent of gold or
      copper. It seems that it once shone brightly in the light, shimmering with
      yellow highlights, but has long lost this feature due to working scratches
      and scuffs.'

    m_Localized: "\u201CIt must fit somewhere\u2026\u201D - the traveler thought
      and began to look for what this item could be intended for. Walking around
      the entire hall up and down, he did not find a suitable place for it and then
      decided to put the item back"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011076
    m_Localized: Climbing the steps again, he approached the motionless ancient robot,
      and returning the artifact to his palm, noticed through the fingers of his
      right hand some kind of depression in the armrest of the throne. He moved his
      hand away and saw a square hole, on the inner walls of which there were gear
      mechanisms, the same as on the sides of the cube outside. Everything looked
      like they should connect with each other and work together.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011077
    m_Localized: 'The robot placed the artifact in a recess, moved it a little from
      side to side, and the gears joined. After that, he tried to spin one of the
      disks on the top face of the cube: all the details began to move, making a
      characteristic sound that goes somewhere far away down, and chess pieces already
      familiar to the robot began to rise from under the floor.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 328699011078
    m_Localized: 'He hurriedly turned the disk in the opposite direction, accidentally
      hitting another one nearby. After that, the figures descended back, and then
      a door leading to other rooms opened slightly in the wall opposite. Previously,
      the robot did not even notice it: so it blended very well with the surroundings.It
      seems that the cube is a kind of key with which you can control this mechanical
      lock, and now the robot is its owner.It is not known what happened to the previous
      owner, sitting on the throne posthumously, but apparently, his reign The robot
      thought that for a start, it should figure out how to open the central gate,
      because it was still locked.However, acting at random, turning all the disks
      at once, was unwise: under the control of this key could be anything, including
      the activation of the guards. There must definitely be some kind of pattern
      in the control mechanism, so the robot decided to study it in detail.'
